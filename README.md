# BitcoinParkPay

This Android application was a school project I worked on for the summer semester of 2015.  Most of the code here except for alot of the GUI stuff is my own work.  Since it was duplicated from an enterprise account, it does not show me as a contributor, although I can be found under the commit history as ticklegr.

This application uses the QR scanner on an Android device to send bitcoin from one address to another and is designed for a parking payment scenario.  The bitcoin is stored in a wallet on block.io and their API is used to send payment.
